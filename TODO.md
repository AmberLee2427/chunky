# TODOs

## 1. Get 'chunky' name on PyPI
- [ ] Investigate if the 'chunky' project on PyPI is abandoned
- [ ] If abandoned, follow PyPI's process for requesting a name transfer: [PyPI Name Claim Help](https://pypi.org/help/#claiming-a-name)
- [ ] If successful, update `pyproject.toml` and republish as `chunky`
